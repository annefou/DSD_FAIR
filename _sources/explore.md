# Explore and discuss the FAIR assessment of existing Research Objects (ROs) 

## What should I do?
- Go to https://w3id.org/ro-id/e3872496-7fef-4456-8608-8d7b094d7d05 
- Browse the resources and discuss in small groups (2 to 3 persons) the FAIR assessment. 
- Write down one or  two observations from your discussion


## Questions to guide your discussion (optional e.g. just for guidance)

- How easy is it to find resources?
- What metadata is needed but missing?
- How do I know if I can reuse the Research Object? And each object in the Research Object?
- What caveats do you see about using Research Objects?
- What practices could you suggest to facilitate reuse?
- What actions could be taken to improve the FAIRness of this RO?
