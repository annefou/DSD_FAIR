# Maintaining and/or improving FAIR ROs when Forking, snapshotting and archiving ROs 

In this section, we aim at discussing the concepts of Forking, snapshotting and archiving ROs.

- Letâ€™s fork the following RO: https://w3id.org/ro-id/e3872496-7fef-4456-8608-8d7b094d7d05 
- Check the FAIR assessment and try to improve the FAIRness of this RO.
- Snapshot the forked RO
- Discuss and for instance, try to answer the following questions:
    - What could be the use of snapshots? 
    - When would you recommend to archive a RO?
    - For both snapshotted and archived ROs, what best practices would you recommend to improve the FAIRness? 
    - Can a RO be FAIR while its resources are not?
    - Can a RO with private data be FAIR?
